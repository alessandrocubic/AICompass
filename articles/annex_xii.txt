Transparency information referred to in Article 53(1), point (b) â€” technical documentation for providers of general-purpose AI models to downstream providers that integrate the model into their AI system

The information referred to in Article 53(1), point (b) shall contain at least the following:

1.A general description of the general-purpose AI model including:

(a)the tasks that the model is intended to perform and the type and nature of AI systems into which it can be integrated;

(b)the acceptable use policies applicable;

(c)the date of release and methods of distribution;

(d)how the model interacts, or can be used to interact, with hardware or software that is not part of the model itself, where applicable;

(e)the versions of relevant software related to the use of the general-purpose AI model, where applicable;

(f)the architecture and number of parameters;

(g)the modality (e.g. text, image) and format of inputs and outputs;

(h)the licence for the model.

2.A description of the elements of the model and of the process for its development, including:

(a)the technical means (e.g. instructions for use, infrastructure, tools) required for the general-purpose AI model to be integrated into AI systems;

(b)the modality (e.g. text, image, etc.) and format of the inputs and outputs and their maximum size (e.g. context window length, etc.);

(c)information on the data used for training, testing and validation, where applicable, including the type and provenance of data and curation methodologies.
