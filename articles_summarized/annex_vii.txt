Annex VII describes the conformity assessment procedure that involves both the evaluation of the quality management system (QMS) and the technical documentation:

1. Overview: The providerâ€™s QMS for AI systems, as specified in Article 17, is reviewed and monitored, while the technical documentation is also assessed for compliance.
2. Quality Management System: Providers must submit an application that details their QMS, which is evaluated by a notified body. The QMS needs to be kept effective, and any changes must be reviewed and approved by the notified body.
3. Technical Documentation: The technical documentation is examined by the notified body, which may request additional evidence or testing. If the AI system meets the requirements, a Union technical documentation assessment certificate is granted.
4. Surveillance: Regular audits are carried out by the notified body to ensure the provider is adhering to the approved QMS, and additional testing of AI systems may be conducted when needed.

This procedure ensures that AI systems comply with the necessary regulatory standards.
