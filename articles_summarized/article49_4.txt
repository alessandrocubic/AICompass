The obligations established in this article state that for high-risk AI systems related to law enforcement, migration, asylum, and border control management, the registration must occur in a secure, non-public section of the EU database referenced in Article 71. This registration will include specific information as outlined in various sections of Annex VIII and Annex IX. Specifically, it must encompass relevant details from Section A (excluding points 6, 8, and 9), Section B (points 1 to 5, and points 8 and 9), and Section C (points 1 to 3) of Annex VIII, as well as points 1, 2, 3, and 5 from Annex IX. This structured approach ensures that sensitive information about high-risk AI systems is securely stored while complying with regulatory requirements.
