1. Provider contact information and details.
2. System characteristics, including intended purpose, performance metrics, limitations, and known risks.
3. Technical specifications and guidance for interpreting outputs.
4. Any predetermined changes and necessary human oversight measures.
5. Required resources, expected lifespan, and maintenance guidelines.
6. Mechanisms for collecting and interpreting system logs.
