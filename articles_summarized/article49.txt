Article 49 outlines the registration requirements for AI systems. Before placing a high-risk AI system listed in Annex III on the market or putting it into service (excluding those referred to in point 2 of Annex III), the provider or authorized representative must register both themselves and the system in the EU database specified in Article 71. Similarly, for AI systems deemed not high-risk according to Article 6(3), the provider or authorized representative must also register themselves and that system in the same EU database. Furthermore, before deploying or using a high-risk AI system listed in Annex III (except those in point 2), deployers that are public authorities or acting on their behalf must register themselves, select the system, and register its use in the EU database referred to in Article 71.
