Annex IV outlines the technical documentation requirements for AI systems as per Article 11(1), detailing the necessary information to ensure compliance and transparency. It includes:

1. General AI System Description: Information on the system's purpose, version history, compatibility with hardware or software, distribution formats, hardware requirements, user interface, and instructions for use.

2. System Development Process: Detailed steps taken during the AI system’s development, including use of third-party tools, design choices, system architecture, data sources and training methodologies, and any pre-trained systems integrated.

3. Human Oversight: An assessment of measures required for human oversight, focusing on how the system’s outputs can be understood by users and how it aligns with Article 14.

4. Testing and Validation: Information on the testing and validation procedures, data used, accuracy metrics, robustness, potential discrimination, and cybersecurity measures.

5. System Monitoring and Control: Insights into system performance, accuracy, foreseeable risks, and unintended outcomes. This section also includes measures for human oversight and details on data inputs.

6. Performance Metrics: Description of the metrics used to assess the system's performance.

7. Risk Management: An outline of the risk management strategies as required by Article 9.

8. Lifecycle Changes: Documentation of any modifications made to the AI system over time.

9. Standards Compliance: A list of standards followed, and where none were used, the alternative methods employed to meet requirements.

10.EU Declaration of Conformity: A copy of the declaration in line with Article 47.

11. Post-Market Monitoring: A plan to monitor the system’s performance after it enters the market, in line with Article 72, including provisions for ongoing oversight.

This documentation ensures that AI systems meet regulatory standards and continue to perform safely and ethically throughout their lifecycle.
