The AI Office and Member States are tasked with encouraging and facilitating the development of codes of conduct aimed at the voluntary application of certain requirements from Chapter III, Section 2 to AI systems, excluding high-risk ones, by considering available technical solutions and industry best practices. These codes should include governance mechanisms and address the voluntary application of specific requirements to all AI systems by deployers, with clear objectives and key performance indicators for measuring success. Elements to be included may encompass Union ethical guidelines for trustworthy AI, minimizing the environmental impact of AI systems, promoting AI literacy, fostering inclusive and diverse design processes, and assessing the potential negative effects on vulnerable groups, including issues of accessibility and gender equality. Codes can be created by individual providers or deployers, organizations representing them, or collaboratively with stakeholders, covering one or more AI systems based on their intended purposes. In this process, the specific needs and interests of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including startups, will be taken into account.
