The obligations outlined in this article specify that for high-risk AI systems related to law enforcement, migration, asylum, and border control management, the registration process must occur in a secure, non-public section of the EU database mentioned in Article 71. This registration must include specific information as detailed in several sections of Annex VIII, specifically Section A (points 1 to 10, excluding points 6, 8, and 9), Section B (points 1 to 5, and points 8 and 9), and Section C (points 1 to 3). Additionally, it must include points 1, 2, 3, and 5 from Annex IX. This requirement ensures that relevant information about high-risk AI systems is securely documented and accessible only to authorized entities, thereby promoting accountability and compliance in sensitive areas.
