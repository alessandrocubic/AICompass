Article 17 requires providers of high-risk AI systems to establish a documented quality management system ensuring compliance with relevant regulations. This system must include strategies for regulatory compliance, design control techniques, development and quality assurance processes, and validation procedures with defined frequencies. It should also outline technical specifications and methods for data management, incorporate a risk management system, and establish post-market monitoring. Additionally, it must include procedures for reporting serious incidents and managing communications with authorities while maintaining thorough record-keeping and resource management. The implementation of these requirements should be proportional to the provider's size, ensuring sufficient rigor for compliance. Providers already subject to quality management obligations under sectoral Union law can integrate these aspects into their existing systems. Financial institutions can fulfill these obligations by adhering to internal governance rules, excluding certain points related to risk management and incident reporting, while considering applicable harmonized standards.
