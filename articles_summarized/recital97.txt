The obligations outlined in this recital emphasize the need for a clear definition of general-purpose AI models, distinguishing them from AI systems to ensure legal certainty. General-purpose AI models are characterized by their capability to perform a wide range of tasks and are typically trained on large datasets using various learning methods. These models can be marketed through different channels, including libraries and APIs, and may be modified into new models. While they are essential components of AI systems, they do not qualify as standalone AI systems without additional elements, such as a user interface. Specific rules apply to general-purpose AI models, particularly those posing systemic risks, and these obligations come into effect once the models are placed on the market. If a provider integrates their model into an AI system, the obligations continue to apply. However, models used internally for processes that do not affect third partiesâ€™ rights are exempt from these obligations. Notably, general-purpose AI models with systemic risks must comply with relevant regulations. The definition excludes models used solely for research, development, and prototyping before market placement, maintaining the requirement for compliance once the models are commercially available.
