Article 22 outlines the responsibilities and requirements for authorised representatives of providers of high-risk AI systems established in third countries. Before these providers can market their systems in the Union, they must appoint an authorised representative located within the Union through a written mandate. This representative is tasked with verifying compliance with the EU declaration of conformity and technical documentation, maintaining essential documents for 10 years, and providing necessary information to competent authorities. They must cooperate with these authorities in risk mitigation efforts and ensure compliance with registration obligations. If the representative believes the provider is not adhering to regulatory obligations, they must terminate the mandate and inform the relevant market surveillance authority and, if applicable, the notified body.
