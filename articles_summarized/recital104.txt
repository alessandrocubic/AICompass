The obligations outlined in this recital specify that providers of general-purpose AI models released under a free and open-source license, who make their parameters, model architecture, and usage information publicly available, may be exempt from certain transparency-related requirements. However, this exemption does not apply if the models are deemed to present systemic risks, in which case the transparency of the model and its open-source status will not negate the need for compliance with regulatory obligations. Additionally, while the open-source release may not disclose substantial information about the training dataset or copyright compliance, the providers are still required to produce a summary of the content used for model training and establish a policy to comply with Union copyright law, particularly regarding the reservation of rights under Directive (EU) 2019/790. This ensures that while promoting transparency and openness in general-purpose AI models, providers remain accountable for addressing copyright issues and disclosing training content.
