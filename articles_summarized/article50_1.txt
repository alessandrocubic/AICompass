This article establishes that providers of AI systems designed for direct interaction with natural persons must ensure that users are informed of their engagement with an AI system. However, this requirement can be waived if the interaction is clearly evident to a reasonably informed and observant person, considering the context and circumstances. Additionally, this transparency obligation does not apply to AI systems legally authorized for detecting, preventing, investigating, or prosecuting criminal offenses, provided that appropriate safeguards for third-party rights are in place. The exception holds unless these systems are accessible to the public for reporting criminal activities.
