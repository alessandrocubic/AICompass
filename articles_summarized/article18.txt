Article 18 establishes that providers of high-risk AI systems must retain specific documentation for a period of ten years after the system has been placed on the market or put into service, ensuring this documentation is available to national competent authorities. This documentation includes the technical documentation outlined in Article 11, quality management system documentation per Article 17, records of changes approved by notified bodies, decisions and documents from notified bodies, and the EU declaration of conformity specified in Article 47. Additionally, each Member State is responsible for determining the conditions under which this documentation remains accessible to authorities in cases where a provider or their authorized representative goes bankrupt or ceases operations before the ten-year period concludes. Providers classified as financial institutions, subject to internal governance requirements under Union financial services law, are required to maintain the technical documentation as part of their compliance with that law.
