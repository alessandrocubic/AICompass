The obligations under the Union harmonization legislation require compliance with safety and regulatory standards across various sectors, including ensuring civil aviation security, approving and conducting market surveillance for two- or three-wheel vehicles and agricultural vehicles, and meeting safety standards for marine equipment. Additionally, regulations mandate interoperability for the rail system, approval processes for motor vehicles and trailers, and adherence to type-approval requirements for vehicle safety and occupant protection. Lastly, cooperation with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency is essential, especially regarding unmanned aircraft and their components. These obligations collectively aim to enhance safety, compliance, and regulatory oversight across these industries within the EU.
