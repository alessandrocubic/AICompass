Article 9 mandates that high-risk AI systems have a comprehensive risk management system that includes:

1. Continuous Process: Establish, document, and maintain a risk management system throughout the AI system's lifecycle.

2. Risk Assessment Steps:
   - Identify and analyze foreseeable risks.
   - Estimate risks from intended use and misuse.
   - Evaluate additional risks from post-market data.
   - Implement targeted risk mitigation measures.

3. Testing: Systems must be tested for compliance and consistent performance, including real-world conditions.

4. Vulnerable Groups: Consider potential impacts on individuals under 18 and other vulnerable groups in the risk management process.
