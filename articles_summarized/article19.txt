Article 19 mandates that providers of high-risk AI systems maintain automatically generated logs as specified in Article 12(1), provided these logs are within their control. The logs must be retained for a duration appropriate to the high-risk AI system's intended purpose, with a minimum retention period of six months, unless otherwise dictated by relevant Union or national laws, particularly those related to personal data protection. Additionally, providers classified as financial institutions and subject to internal governance requirements under Union financial services law must keep these logs as part of the documentation required by that law.
