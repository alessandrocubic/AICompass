Article 10.6 outlines data governance requirements for developing high-risk AI systems that do not involve training AI models. Key points include:

1. Data Sets: The testing data sets must be relevant, representative, and as error-free as possible, with appropriate statistical properties.

2. Conditions for Data Handling:
   - Document design choices, data collection processes, and origins.
   - Address data preparation operations, such as cleaning and annotation.
   - Assess data availability and suitability.
   - Identify and mitigate biases that could affect health, safety, or fundamental rights.
   - Identify data gaps and strategies to address them.

3. Processing Personal Data: Providers may process special categories of personal data for bias detection and correction, provided:
   - Other data cannot fulfil this purpose.
   - Data security and privacy measures are implemented.
   - Data is not shared and is deleted once biases are corrected or after the retention period.

4. Compliance: All processing must comply with relevant EU regulations regarding personal data protection.
