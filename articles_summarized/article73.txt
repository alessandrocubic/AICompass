Providers of high-risk AI systems placed on the Union market must report any serious incident to the market surveillance authorities of the Member States where the incident occurs. The report should be made immediately after establishing a causal link between the AI system and the serious incident, or within 15 days of awareness of the incident, considering its severity. In cases of widespread infringement or serious incidents as defined in Article 3, point (49)(b), the report must be provided within two days. If a death is involved, the report is required immediately upon establishing a causal relationship, but no later than 10 days from awareness. Providers may submit an incomplete initial report if necessary, followed by a complete one. Following such a report, the provider must promptly investigate the incident, including a risk assessment and corrective actions, while cooperating with competent authorities without altering the AI system in a way that affects further evaluations before informing those authorities. Upon receiving notifications of serious incidents, market surveillance authorities must inform relevant national public authorities or bodies, and the Commission will develop guidance for compliance by August 2, 2025, which will be regularly assessed. The authorities must take appropriate measures within seven days of receiving notifications, and for high-risk AI systems under other Union legislative instruments with equivalent reporting obligations, notifications will be limited to specific serious incidents. Lastly, for high-risk AI systems that are safety components or devices under Regulations (EU) 2017/745 and (EU) 2017/746, notifications will be restricted to specific incidents and must be made to the national competent authority designated by the Member State where the incident occurred, with national competent authorities required to notify the Commission of any serious incident immediately.
