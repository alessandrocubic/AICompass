The obligations outlined in this regulation emphasize the need for a clear and internationally aligned definition of "AI system" to ensure legal certainty and facilitate global acceptance while allowing for flexibility amid rapid technological advancements. The definition should highlight key characteristics that distinguish AI systems from traditional software, specifically focusing on their ability to infer and derive outputs like predictions and decisions that influence their operating environments. AI systems are expected to operate with varying levels of autonomy, demonstrating self-learning capabilities post-deployment. Additionally, the regulation clarifies that AI systems may function independently or as components of a product, regardless of their integration level. These obligations aim to create a comprehensive framework for the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies.
