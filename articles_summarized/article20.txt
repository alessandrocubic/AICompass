Article 20 outlines the responsibilities of providers of high-risk AI systems concerning corrective actions and information duties. If providers determine or suspect that their AI system is not compliant with the regulations, they must take immediate corrective measures to achieve conformity, which may include withdrawing, disabling, or recalling the system as necessary. They are required to inform relevant parties, such as distributors, deployers, authorized representatives, and importers, of these actions. Furthermore, if a risk is identified under Article 79(1), the provider must promptly investigate its causes, collaborate with the reporting deployer when applicable, and notify the relevant market surveillance authorities and any applicable notified body about the nature of the non-compliance and corrective measures taken.
