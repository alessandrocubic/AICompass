Providers of high-risk AI systems must establish and document a post-market monitoring system that is proportionate to the nature of the AI technologies and associated risks. If an existing post-market monitoring system and plan are already established under EU legislation, providers may integrate the necessary elements into these frameworks to ensure consistency and minimize additional burdens, provided that it maintains an equivalent level of protection. This system should include collecting relevant performance data from deployers or other sources throughout the AI system's lifetime, effectively documenting this data, and analyzing it to evaluate ongoing compliance with the requirements set forth in the AI Act.
