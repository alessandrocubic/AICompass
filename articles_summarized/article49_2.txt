The obligations outlined in this article require that before an AI system deemed not to be high-risk is placed on the market or put into service, the provider, or their authorized representative, must register both themselves and the AI system in the EU database specified in Article 71. This registration process is essential for maintaining transparency and regulatory oversight within the European Union's framework for AI systems, ensuring that even non-high-risk systems are documented and traceable.
