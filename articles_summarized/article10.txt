Data and Data Governance mandates that: 

1. Quality Standards: High-risk AI systems using training, validation, and testing data must meet specific quality criteria.

Role: Data Scientist

2. Data Governance: Data sets must follow management practices that ensure:
   - Appropriate design and collection processes.
   - Assessment of data origin and purpose, especially for personal data.
   - Data preparation operations (e.g., annotation, cleaning).
   - Assumptions about data representation.
   - Evaluation of data availability and suitability.
   - Bias examination to prevent negative impacts on health, safety, or fundamental rights.
   - Measures for bias detection and correction.
   - Identification of data gaps and strategies to address them.

Role : Lead Data Scientist

3. Data Characteristics: Data sets should be relevant, representative, error-free, and complete, reflecting the intended population.

Role: Data Scientist

4. Contextual Considerations: Data sets must account for geographical and contextual specifics relevant to their intended use.

Role: Data Scientist

5. Processing Personal Data: Providers may process special categories of personal data for bias detection if:
   - Other data cannot fulfil this purpose.
   - Strong security and privacy measures are in place.
   - Data is not shared with unauthorised parties.
   - Data is deleted after bias correction or upon reaching retention limits.

Role: Lead Data Scientist

6. Limited Applicability: For high-risk AI systems not involving model training, the governance provisions apply only to testing data sets.
